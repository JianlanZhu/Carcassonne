# 15-214(514) Homework 4 - 4a

This project is the homework 4a of course 15-214.

## Getting Started

There are 7 pdf files in this homework.

1. domain.pdf: The domain model.
2. system sequence.pdf: The system sequence diagram for Carcassonne.
3. behavioral contract.pdf: The behavioral contract for placing a tile without a follower.
4. interaction tile validation.pdf: response to the scenario about validating a placed tile.
5. interaction cloister scoring.pdf: response to the scenario about scoring completed regions following a tile placement.
6. object.pdf: The object model.
7. rationale.pdf: My justification of design decisions.

There are some things to clarify here.

* In the domain model diagram, I did not mean to show the detail implementation of design (like "+" and the "()"). The diagram looks like this because I used the StarURL application and it can only draw domain model diagram like this. Please ignore those symbols.
* The similar things also happened when I drew system sequence diagram. Please ignore those symbols.
